📚 Virtual Library Explorer (Built with Snap!)
Created by: Rajendran, Tan Zhen Ping, Sangeerthanaa, Ng Xin Min

Project Description:
"Virtual Library Explorer" is an innovative, game-based educational program developed in Snap!, designed to offer an immersive tour of our library in a fun and interactive way. Users control a character who can freely walk around the virtual library, interact with various sections, and learn about different facilities and services within the space.

The experience is enhanced with:

🎮 Interactive mini-games hidden throughout the library

🗣️ AI-powered voiceovers that guide users through each section

🧩 Gamified exploration that makes learning about the library fun and engaging

Despite Snap!’s limitations, we pushed the boundaries of what the platform can do—integrating animation, voiceovers, and logic-based interactions to build a feature-rich experience. This project not only showcases our technical creativity but also reimagines how libraries can be introduced to students in a digital age.
